I've recently signed up for Dr. Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2023. I've been wanting to learn Python for a while now, and I've heard good things about the course, so I'm excited to get started.

I'm not new to coding by any means, but I've never really worked in Python past an intro course here and there. I've done a little bit of work in Go, but I've mostly worked in Bash, PowerShell, and JavaScript. I'm hoping that this course will help me get up to speed with Python quickly.

On Day One, we're covering material that is mostly review for me (input/output, variables) but it was still an enjoyable day. I do wonder if someone was completely new to programming would be able to keep up with the pace of the course. I'm sure that Dr. Yu has thought of this, but I'm curious to see how the course progresses as it goes on.

Today's final project was a very simple CLI-based Band Name Generator.

{% highlight Python %}
print("Welcome to the Band Name Generator.")
street = input("What's the name of the city you grew up in?\n")
pet = input("What's your pet's name?\n")
print("Your band name could be " + street + " " + pet)
{% endhighlight %}
